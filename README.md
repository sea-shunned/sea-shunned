I'm a machine learning engineer at the Francis Crick Institute, supporting awesome scientists by helping and designing ML solutions for their problems. This is mostly related to image analysis, but we help with anything from finetuning foundation models to segment new tissue/modalities etc. to more of a research software engineer role, where we can help package/optimise/improve existing solutions. It's a varied job üòÑ

Feel free to get in touch about anything...but I'm probably most useful if it's related to:
- Image analysis, esp.:
  - Segmentation, whether it's SAM or "just a U-Net"...finetuning, training, debugging etc.
  - Napari, plugin development or otherwise
- Nextflow pipelines ‚ù§Ô∏è
- LLMs for biologists
- Anything I did during postdoc or PhD (memory notwithstanding):
  - Clustering
  - ML for disease progression modelling in Alzheimer's
  - Stratified clinical trials
  - Synthetic data
  - Evolutionary algorithms
